## Stroke Data Analysis ##

### 1. Problem Statement - Analysing stroke dataset available and finding relationships among variables with stroke  ###
 Steps:-
* Data Exploration and analysis, Data Visualisation
* Outlier analysis and missing value handling
* Finding good predictors using feature selection method 
* Conclusion and Next steps 


### 2. Process
### 2.1. Data
- Stroke dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data

### 2.2. Data Exploration and analysis, Data Visualisation 

* Data type correction
* Visualising stroke along with other variables and understanding the relationships
* Understanding distributions of independent variables.

### 2.3 Outlier analysis, missing value handling
* Finding outliers using boxplots(IQR) and handling 
* Finding missing values and handling

### 2.4 Finding good predictors using feature selection methods  
* Quantising relationship of independent variables with target variable using chi square,IV and WOE
